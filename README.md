# Primitives for users to create their own pseudo-deterministic workflows
* Workflow: User can chat with Mia to create a "Skill" (Inspired by [Voyager](https://github.com/MineDojo/Voyager) then save it to be used later)
* Mia should prompt user to test workflow on some mock data to verify workflow is working as planned before trying on real data (Gmail/Gcal)

# Tools
* Structured Outputs, tool calling, information extraction
* ideas in [SWARM](https://github.com/openai/swarm)
